Things to do once you open project:
   1. Install dependencies (in terminal, may change depending on user firmware)
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
   2. Start the app
      ```bash
      npx expo start -c --tunnel
      ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
